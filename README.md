# All That Apply!

All That Apply! is a simple quiz application using React.

## Access

Just click the link here to try it out (https://amendozaquizapp.netlify.app/)!

## Future Implementations

More quiz options: All That Apply uses a free JSON hosting site to request quiz information via an API call, so adding new quiz content should be straightforward.

Make your own quiz: I can utilize a WRITE component to allow users to write basiz questions and answers choices, which would then be submitted as a JSON file that can be read in normal fashion.
