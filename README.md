# All That Apply!

All That Apply! is a simple quiz application using React. Originally inspired by a full-stack application submission, I later expanded on the requirements by incorporating an API to fetch several potential quiz options, and used Framer-Motion JS to breathe life into the app with fluid animation transitions and a responsive UI experience.

## Future Implementations

Make your own quiz: utilizing a WRITE component to allow users to write basic questions and answers choices, which would then be submitted as a JSON file.
